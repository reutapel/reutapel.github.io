I am a data scientist at K Health, dedicated to advancing AI and NLP technologies to revolutionize healthcare. 
I hold a Phd from [The Faculty of Data and Decision Sciences](https://web.iem.technion.ac.il/site/) at the [Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il/) where I conducted pioneering research at the interaction between Natural Language Processing (NLP), Game Theory, and Decision Making, under the supervision of Prof. [Roi Reichart](https://ie.technion.ac.il/~roiri/) Prof. [Moshe Tenneholtz](https://web.iem.technion.ac.il/site/academicstaff/moshe-tennenholtz/) and Prof. [Ido Erev](https://web.iem.technion.ac.il/site/academicstaff/ido-erev/).

**My PhD research focused on the use of natural language messages to predict players' actions in persuasion games.** Persuasion games are widely researched in economic modeling and artificial intelligence and serve as a solid foundation for powerful applications, such as recommendation systems and social networks. However, there is no use of natural language messages in the classic persuasion games setting, although natural language is a very common communication signal in real-world persuasion setups.
In my research, I explore the impact of verbal communication on social interactions in persuasion games and the use of language in predicting human actions in persuasion setups.

I was one of the first three students and the first female student in the Technion Data Science and Engineering BSc program. 
Before joining K Health, I worked as a data scientist at Intel and as an NLP researcher at Microsoft.
