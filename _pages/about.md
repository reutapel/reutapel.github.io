I am a PhD candidate in the [IE&M Faculty](https://web.iem.technion.ac.il/site/) at the [Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il/) working on the interaction between Natural Language Processing (NLP), Game Theory, and Decision Making. My advisors are Prof. [Roi Reichart](https://ie.technion.ac.il/~roiri/) Prof. [Moshe Tenneholtz](https://web.iem.technion.ac.il/site/academicstaff/moshe-tennenholtz/) and Prof. [Ido Erev](https://web.iem.technion.ac.il/site/academicstaff/ido-erev/).

**My research focuses on the use of natural language messages to predict players' actions in persuasion games.** Persuasion games are widely researched in economic modeling and artificial intelligence and serve as a solid foundation for powerful applications, such as recommendation systems and social networks. However, there is no use of natural language messages in the classic persuasion games setting, although natural language is a very common communication signal in real-world persuasion setups.
In my research, I explore the impact of verbal communication on social interactions in persuasion games and the use of language in predicting human actions in persuasion setups.

I am also an NLP researcher Intern at Microsoft.
